## clsFocus


</div>

### Description

clsFocus is a class that can be associated with a form, allowing to perform data entry checking and focus handling with almost no code at all..., just associate the form with the class, and create ONLY ONE validation Sub for all the controls on the Form, it's that easy...

Please rate it, it just takes a while, I would love to read your comments...
